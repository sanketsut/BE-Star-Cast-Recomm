# BE-Star-Cast-Recomm
# This is my final year project (thesis) for my Bachelors in Computer Engineering

# When the module is given input as budget of a film and the genre of the film, the system gives a list of actors that have better likelihood of working together
# well and making the film commercially successful at the box office

# It takes into account the entire history of how every actor performed for all possible genres at the box office.
# It also considers which actors will work together well and which will not, so that the combination is also successful
