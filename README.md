# BE-Star-Cast-Recomm
This is my final year project (thesis) for my Bachelors in Computer Engineering

A tool to predict the ideal star cast for a movie such that it becomes critically and commercially successful.  
The system analyses all previous box-office performances of all actors with respect to genre and creates an individual rating, providing suggestions of actors best for the selected genre, that fit the budget and are available. Utilizes the 0-1 Knapsack and Apriori algorithms to implement the system.  
Received a 1.0 grade for the project and stood runner up among 120 team projects.  


When the module is given input as budget of a film and the genre of the film, the system gives a list of actors that have better likelihood of working together well and making the film commercially successful at the box office

It takes into account the entire history of how every actor performed for all possible genres at the box office.
It also considers which actors will work together well and which will not, so that the combination is also successful
